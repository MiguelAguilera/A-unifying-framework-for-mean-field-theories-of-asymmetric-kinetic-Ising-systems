# A unifying framework for mean field theories of asymmetric kinetic Ising systems

Code reproducing the models used in the article Aguilera, M, Moosavi, SA & Shimazaki H (2018). A unifying framework for mean field theories of asymmetric kinetic Ising systems.

## Abstract

Kinetic Ising models are powerful tools for studying the non-equilibrium dynamics of complex systems. As their behaviour is not tractable for large networks, many mean-field methods have been proposed for its analysis, each based on unique assumptions about the system's temporal evolution. This disparity of methods makes it challenging to systematically advance mean-field approaches beyond previous contributions. Here, we propose a unified framework for mean-field theories of asymmetric kinetic Ising systems from a geometric perspective. The framework is built on Plefka expansions of a system around a simplified model obtained by an orthogonal projection to a sub-manifold of tractable probability distributions. This view not only unifies previous methods but also allows us to develop novel methods that, in contrast with traditional approaches, preserve the system's correlations. We show that these new methods can outperform previous ones in predicting and assessing network properties near critical regimes. 

## Description of the code

The code reproducing the approximation methods in the paper is contained in:
* 'mf_ising.py', calling the functions to perform each approximation
* 'plefka_functions.py', containing the functions computing the equations behind each approximation

To reproduce the results in the paper, the following steps are necessary:
* Simulation data of the asymmetric SK model to test against the models can be generated using 'generate_data.py', which uses 'kinetic_ising.py' to update a kinetic Ising model.
* The forward Ising problem is computed with 'forward-Ising-problem.py', which compares the result with the simulated data. The figure containing the results can be generated using 'forward-Ising-problem-results.py'
* The inverse Ising problem is computed with 'inverse-Ising-problem.py', which estimates the model parameters from the simulated data. The figure containing the results can be generated using 'inverse-Ising-problem-results.py'
* Simulation data for testing phase reconstruction can be computed using 'generate_data_transition.py'.
* The phase transition reconstruction results can be reproduced running 'reconstruction-Ising-problem.py', which computes the forward Ising problem for the original models (with more values of Î²) and the models from solving the inverse problem. The figure containing the results can be generated using 'reconstruction-Ising-problem-results.py'
* Finally, a comparison of execution times (Supplementary note), can be computed using 'execution-time-results.py'

Note that some steps (specially those involving simulation of the models without approximations) are computationally costly. Alternatively, the data used for reproducing the exact results in the paper can be accessed in the Zenodo repository XXX
