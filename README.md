# A unifying framework for mean field theories of asymmetric kinetic Ising systems

Code reproducing the models used in the article Aguilera, M, Moosavi, SA & Shimazaki H (2018). A unifying framework for mean field theories of asymmetric kinetic Ising systems.

## Abstract

Kinetic Ising models are powerful tools for studying the non-equilibrium dynamics of complex systems. As their behaviour is not tractable for large networks, many mean-field methods have been proposed for its analysis, each based on unique assumptions about the system's temporal evolution. This disparity of methods makes it challenging to systematically advance mean-field approaches beyond previous contributions. Here, we propose a unified framework for mean-field theories of asymmetric kinetic Ising systems from a geometric perspective. The framework is built on Plefka expansions of a system around a simplified model obtained by an orthogonal projection to a sub-manifold of tractable probability distributions. This view not only unifies previous methods but also allows us to develop novel methods that, in contrast with traditional approaches, preserve the system's correlations. We show that these new methods can outperform previous ones in predicting and assessing network properties near critical regimes.
